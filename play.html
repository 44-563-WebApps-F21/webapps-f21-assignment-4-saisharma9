<h2> THE
    DUCHESS OF PADUA</h3>
    <h3>ACT I</h3>
    <h4>_The Market Place of Padua at noon_; _in the background is the great
        Cathedral of Padua_; _the architecture is Romanesque_, _and wrought in
        black and white marbles_; _a flight of marble steps leads up to the
        Cathedral door_; _at the foot of the steps are two large stone lions_;
        _the houses on each aide of the stage have coloured awnings from their
        windows_, _and are flanked by stone arcades_; _on the right of the stage
        is the public fountain_, _with a triton in green bronze blowing from a
        conch_; _around the fountain is a stone seat_; _the bell of the Cathedral
        is ringing_, _and the citizens_, _men_, _women and children_, _are
        passing into the Cathedral_.</h4>

        ASCANIO

   I would it were somewhere else, for I see no wine-shop.

GUIDO

   [_Taking a letter from his pocket and reading it_.]  ‘The hour noon;
   the city, Padua; the place, the market; and the day, Saint Philip’s
   Day.’

ASCANIO

   And what of the man, how shall we know him?

GUIDO [_reading still_]

   ‘I will wear a violet cloak with a silver falcon broidered on the
   shoulder.’  A brave attire, Ascanio.

ASCANIO

   I’d sooner have my leathern jerkin.  And you think he will tell you of
   your father?

GUIDO

   Why, yes!  It is a month ago now, you remember; I was in the vineyard,
   just at the corner nearest the road, where the goats used to get in, a
   man rode up and asked me was my name Guido, and gave me this letter,
   signed ‘Your Father’s Friend,’ bidding me be here to-day if I would
   know the secret of my birth, and telling me how to recognise the
   writer!  I had always thought old Pedro was my uncle, but he told me
   that he was not, but that I had been left a child in his charge by
   some one he had never since seen.

ASCANIO

   And you don’t know who your father is?

GUIDO

   No.

ASCANIO

   No recollection of him even?
