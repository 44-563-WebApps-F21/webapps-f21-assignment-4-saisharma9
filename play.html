   <p class="speech">I would it were somewhere else, for I see no wine-shop.</p> </p> 

<p><h4 class="GUIDO">GUIDO</h4>

  <p class="stage-direction"> [_Taking a letter from his pocket and reading it_.]</p><p class="speech">  ‘The hour noon;
   the city, Padua; the place, the market; and the day, Saint Philip’s
   Day.’</p> </p>

<p><h4 class="ASCANIO">ASCANIO</h4>

  <p class="speech"> And what of the man, how shall we know him?</p></p>

<p><h4 class="GUIDO">GUIDO</h4> <p class="stage-direction">[_reading still_]</p>

   <p class="speech">‘I will wear a violet cloak with a silver falcon broidered on the
   shoulder.’  A brave attire, Ascanio.</p></p>

<p><h4 class="ASCANIO">ASCANIO</h4>

   <p class="speech">I’d sooner have my leathern jerkin.  And you think he will tell you of
   your father?</p></p>

<p><h4 class="GUIDO">GUIDO</h4>

   <p class="speech">Why, yes!  It is a month ago now, you remember; I was in the vineyard,
   just at the corner nearest the road, where the goats used to get in, a
   man rode up and asked me was my name Guido, and gave me this letter,
   signed ‘Your Father’s Friend,’ bidding me be here to-day if I would
   know the secret of my birth, and telling me how to recognise the
   writer!  I had always thought old Pedro was my uncle, but he told me
   that he was not, but that I had been left a child in his charge by
   some one he had never since seen.</p></p>

<p><h4 class="ASCANIO">ASCANIO</h4>

   <p class="speech">And you don’t know who your father is?</p></p>

<p><h4 class="GUIDO">GUIDO</h4>

<p class="speech"> No.</p></p>

<p><h4 class="ASCANIO">ASCANIO</h4>

   <p class="speech">No recollection of him even?</p></p>
