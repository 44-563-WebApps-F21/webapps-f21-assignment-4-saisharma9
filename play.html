<h2> THE
    DUCHESS OF PADUA</h2>
    <h3>ACT I : The Market Place of Padua</h3>
    

       <p>ASCANIO

   I would it were somewhere else, for I see no wine-shop. </p> 

<p>GUIDO

   [_Taking a letter from his pocket and reading it_.]  ‘The hour noon;
   the city, Padua; the place, the market; and the day, Saint Philip’s
   Day.’ </p>

<p>ASCANIO

   And what of the man, how shall we know him?</p>

<p>GUIDO [_reading still_]

   ‘I will wear a violet cloak with a silver falcon broidered on the
   shoulder.’  A brave attire, Ascanio.</p>

<p>ASCANIO

   I’d sooner have my leathern jerkin.  And you think he will tell you of
   your father?</p>

<p>GUIDO

   Why, yes!  It is a month ago now, you remember; I was in the vineyard,
   just at the corner nearest the road, where the goats used to get in, a
   man rode up and asked me was my name Guido, and gave me this letter,
   signed ‘Your Father’s Friend,’ bidding me be here to-day if I would
   know the secret of my birth, and telling me how to recognise the
   writer!  I had always thought old Pedro was my uncle, but he told me
   that he was not, but that I had been left a child in his charge by
   some one he had never since seen.</p>

<p>ASCANIO

   And you don’t know who your father is?</p>

<p>GUIDO

   No.</p>

<p>ASCANIO

   No recollection of him even?</p>
